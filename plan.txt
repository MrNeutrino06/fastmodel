As I clarfied in README, this library is supposed to be as simple as possible for devs that barely know anything about AI.
I want to follow three-lines strategy:
End-to-end fastmodel creation(1),training(2) and deployment(3) should have exactly 3 lines: 

model = Model(size,task)
model.fit(data)
model.deploy()


Here is my intial look at library:

fastmodel
   |__setup.py
   |__models
   |   |__ __init__.py
   |   |__Model.py
   |   |__Perceptron.py
   |   |__RNN.py
   |   |__CNN.py
   |   |__Transformer.py
   |   |__RLAgent.py
   |__utils
   |   |__Exceptrion.py
   |   |   |__(Here should be a lot of exceptrions)
   |   |__helper.py
   |   |__numbers.py

All models subclass from Model class,
which contains basic features for all classes,
such as - data manipulation, initialisation
mechanism and training.
