# fastmodel
Machine learning and Deep learning library that follows philosophy "less code, less time"

I, MrNeutrino, main developer of this library, keep my focus on writing super simplified library for automatized creation, deployment 
and integration of different AI models in existing code.
My main goal is to maintain such a tool that would offer excellent performance in less than 10 lines. I believe that there integration of 
AI should be simplified even further, until this is as easy as list operations in Python, which were considered high-level abstractions 
in that time. Our days are far beyonf time where we had to code models even models from stratch. I think we, ML geeks and engineers 
should keep our knowledge secret and do not scare ordinary devs with our Adams, Atenttions, ReLUs and ectera. Foy you it may sounds as 
ABCD, but for it most of devs nowadays it is still something very close to quantum mechanics.

I want to give opportunity for people to never print words "torch","tensorflow" or even "trnasformers"
